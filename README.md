Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce manual efforts. Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.
# Credit_Card_classifier
- Solving the classifier for the credit card is not a new problem, this project is more focused on data handling and
exploring.
- Using many ML algorithms (MLPClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, SVM,
StackingClassifier) with a comparison with a related paper for an objective perspective.
